# Sprinter
Speed up your Rails development with one-git-checkout-and-bash-script-install

## What does it do?
It adds `sprinter` (bash script) to your bin path and detects if there is spring-loaded rake available in your current folder whenever you run `rake`. Continue using your normal workflow but get the massive speed gain from running the spring-loaded version from Rails.

## How to install
Checkout and install the script by running:
 `cd /tmp; git clone git@github.com:MrTin/sprinter.git && cd sprinter; ./install.sh'`

Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

## Contributing
Just clone the repo, push a new branch and open up a PR.

## Supported platforms
This has only been tested on `OS X 10.9` and `OS X 10.10` but I don't see why this should not work on any major *nix distribution too.
